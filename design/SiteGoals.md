# Site Goals

The design and development of daytondv.com will be done with the following
goals in mind:

* Encourage participation
* Build people up to speaking at an event
* Teach
* Design and build in the open


## Encourage participation
In the 2015 year end survey, when asked for reasons they came to the meetups,
"hearing great speakers" and "networking" were the two highest rated
responses.


## Build people up to speaking at an event
We can use the website to help ease members into speaking at future events.
We will maintain a list of proposed topics on the site that members can
look through for ideas. We'll also encourage members to submit articles for
publication on our blog.


## Teach
Teaching data visualization techniques and tools should be a priority for our
group and also the site. We should have some tutorials on the site and help
members level up their skills.


## Design and build in the open
Over our first year, we've built a great community of data visualization
enthusiasts who are eager to help. We should design the site in the open and
encourage members to get involved and help with the building of the site.
