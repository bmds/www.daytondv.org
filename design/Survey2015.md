# 2015 Member Survey Results
Some of these were checkboxes (multiple answers per question) and some
responders skipped over certain questions. That's why the percentages don't
work out to 100% all the time.


Next year, I would like to see more talks about:
* Languages: 46%
* Tools: 40%
* Concepts: 80%


The language I use most for Data Visualization is:
* JavaScript: 53%
* Matlab: 13%
* R: 0%
* Python: 13%
* Other (C/C++): 6%


Lunch time meetings quarterly were preferred by the majority of responders.
One did suggest that we have some weekend events.


Nearly 100% of responders are interested in half day workshops. They were split
50/50 on whether or not they would attend if there was a fee involved.


I come to DDV meetings to:
* Hear great speakers: 76%
* Hear about job opportunities: 7%
* Hear about tools: 100%
* Network with others: 70%
* Sponsors: 7%


50% of responders are interested in speaking at a future event. 62% of those
would like a list of proposed topics, and 12% would do it if could compensate
speakers.


## Comments

There were several presentations that only showed final results, which isn't very helpful. Please advise speakers to explain *how* they achieve what they are presenting (i.e. code snippets, tool demos, etc.).


Some weekend events would be excellent.
