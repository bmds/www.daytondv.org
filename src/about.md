# About

The Dayton Data Visualization meetup was started by
Michael Bowman and
Chris Dickman
of [Applied Information Sciences](http://workatais.com)
in November of 2014 as a way to gather Dayton area data visualization
experts to network and share knowledge. Since then, we've grown to 300 members
and have hosted a number of great speakers on a wide variety of topics.

You can register for the group and join us at our events from our
[meetup page](http://meetup.com/daytondv). We'd love to see you at our
next event.
