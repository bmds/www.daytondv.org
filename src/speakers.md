# Speakers

Hello there! The Dayton Data Visualization group would love to have you
present at a future event. Yes, **you**! Speaking at a user group will look
great on your resume and will help motivate you to really dig in to a topic
and understand it enough to present to the group.

Our meetups are perfect for first
time speakers or those wanting to try out new material. We schedule two
speakers for each meetup, each with twenty
minutes of speaking time (plus five to ten minutes for questions).
This is to lower the barrier of entry for new speakers and to make the
talks less of a time commitment from the speakers (and audience). Keep
them short, sweet, and specific.

What makes a good presentation topic for DDV? Here are some ideas:

- **Case Studies**      - Show us how you made a cool visualization or infographic
- **Development Tips**  - Show us how to use a cool new tool or framework
- **Benchmarks**        - Comparisons between tools or frameworks
- **Data Mining**       - Show us how you mine/retrieve data to use in your visualizations
- **Optimization**      - Show us how you optimize your visualizations for performance on the web and mobile devices

If you're interested in speaking at a future event, please email
[Michael Bowman](mailto:bowmanmc@gmail.com) or
[Chris Dickman](mailto:chris.dickman@appliedis.com) and we'll work out
the details.
